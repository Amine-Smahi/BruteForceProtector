## What is a sitemap and why is it important?
Sitemaps are a protocol that allows the webmaster for a website to inform Google and other major search engines about URLS on a website that are available for crawling. Sitemaps allow search engines to find all of your webpages, that they might otherwise miss when indexing. The XML sitemap allows you to specify additional information about each URL such as:
* When it was last updated
* How often the site changes
* How important the page is in relation to other pages on the site
Having this information within one document helps search engines understand your website and crawl it more intelligently.
